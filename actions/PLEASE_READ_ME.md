# TAKE NOTE

This whole application uses _`server actions`_ apart from some authentication that uses api routes, we chose _`server actions`_ due to the faster performance compared to api routes. Server actions are also easy to read and understand and requires less code.

- The server actions in the root of _`"./actions"`_ are used in the admin area
- The server actions in the _`"./actions/home"`_ are used in the public/home area.
